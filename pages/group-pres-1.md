The professor will create small teams of 3-4 students. Each team will be responsible for reading about one of the six common pitfalls of data analysis described by [this post](http://simplystatistics.org/2016/02/01/a-menagerie-of-messed-up-data-analyses-and-how-to-avoid-them/) at the Simply Statistics blog. The group will then prepare and present a brief (5-7 minute) presentation to the entire class on Thursday, March 10. 

The six pitfalls are:

* Outcome switching. 
* The garden of forking paths. 
* P-hacking.
* Uncorrected multiple testing.
* "I got a big one here". 
* Double complication. 

The presentation should provide the following details:
 * Define the pitfall
 * Give some detail about an example of the pitfall. You may use the example cited by the original author of the post. Consider adding additinal detail, such as figures/results from the actual paper/example he cites.
 * The quick recipe for avoiding the pitfall.
 * Optional: provide some commentary on how big of an issue you think this pitfall really is or could be in modern scientific research.
