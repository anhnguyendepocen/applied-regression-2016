The professor will create small teams of 3-4 students. Each team will be responsible for running a small simulation study on stepwise selection methods for regression. The teams will have in-class time to design and prepare the study, but this assignment will also require some out-of-class preparation time. After running the simulations study, the team will prepare and present a brief (5-7 minute) presentation that will be given to the entire class on Thursday, March 24.
