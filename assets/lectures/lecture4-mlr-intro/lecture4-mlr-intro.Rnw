%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Motivation}

Most applications involve more that one covariate -- if more than one thing can influence an outcome, you need multiple linear regression.
\bi
	\myitem Improved description of $y | \bx$
	\myitem More accurate estimates and predictions
	\myitem Allow testing of multiple effects
	\myitem Includes multiple predictor types
\ei

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Why not bin all predictors?}

\bi
	\myitem Divide $x_i$ into $k_i$ bins
	\myitem Stratify data based on inclusion in bins across $x$'s
	\myitem Find mean of the $y_i$ in each category
	\myitem Possibly a reasonable non-parametric model
\ei

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Why not bin all predictors?}

\bi
	\myitem More predictors = more bins
	\myitem If each $x$ has 5 bins, you have $5^p$ overall categories
	\myitem May not have enough data to estimate distribution in each category
	\myitem Curse of dimensionality is a problem in a lot of non-parametric statistics

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Multiple linear regression model}

\bi
	\myitem Observe data $(y_i, x_{i1}, \ldots, x_{ip})$ for subjects $1, \ldots, n$. Want to estimate $\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p$ in the model
	$$ y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{i1} + \ldots + \beta_1x_{ip} + \epsilon_i; \mbox{ } \epsilon_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} (0,\sigma^2)$$
	\myitem Assumptions (residuals have mean zero, constant variance, are independent) are as in SLR
	\myitem Impose linearity which (as in the SLR) is a big assumption
	\myitem Our primary interest will be $E(y | \bx)$
	\myitem Eventually estimate model parameters using least squares
\ei

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Predictor types}

\bi
	\myitem Continuous
	\myitem Categorical
	\myitem Ordinal
\ei

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[t]{Interpretation of coefficients}

$\beta_0 = E(y | x_1 = 0, \ldots, x = 0)$
\bi
	\myitem Centering some of the $x$'s may make this more interpretable
\ei

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[t]{Interpretation of $\beta_1$}

\bigskip

\only<2>{$\beta_1 = $ the expected change in $y$ for a one unit increase in $x_1$, holding all other $x$'s constant.}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Example with two predictors}

Suppose we want to regress weight on age and sex.
\bi
	\myitem Model is $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i, age} + \beta_2 x_{i, sex} + \epsilon_i$
	\myitem Age is continuous starting with age 0; sex is binary, coded so that $x_{i,sex} = 0$ for men and $x_{i,sex} = 1$ for women
\ei


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Omitted variable bias}

What happens if the true regression model is
$$ y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i,1} + \beta_2 x_{i,2} + \epsilon_i$$
but  we ignore $x_2$ and fit the simple linear regression
$$ y_i = \beta^{*}_0 + \beta^{*}_1 x_{i,1} + \epsilon^{*}_i$$

Does $\beta^{*}_1 = \beta_{1}$? 

\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Omitted variable bias}

\begin{block}{When should you be concerned?}
If both of the following conditions are met, then  $\beta^{*}_1 = \beta_1$:
\bi
    \myitem The omitted variable is unrelated to the outcome
    \myitem The omitted variable is uncorrelated with the retained variable
\ei
\end{block}

Note: A Simpson's paradox can be explained by omitted variable bias.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Matrix notation}

\bi
        \myitem Observe data $(y_i, x_{i1}, \ldots, x_{ip})$ for subjects $1, \ldots, n$. Want to estimate $\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p$ in the model
	$$ y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{i1} + \ldots + \beta_1x_{ip} + \epsilon_i; \mbox{ } \epsilon_i \stackrel{iid}{\sim} (0,\sigma^2)$$
	\myitem Notation is cumbersome. To fix this, let
	\bi
		\myitem $\bx_i = [1, x_{i1}, \ldots, x_{ip}]$
		\myitem $\bbeta^{T} = [\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \bbeta_{p}]$
		\myitem Then $y_i = \bx_i \bbeta + \epsilon_i$
	\ei

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Multiple linear regression}

\bi
        \myitem Let
	\begin{displaymath}\tiny
	\by = \left[
		\begin{array}{c}
		y_1 \\
		\vdots \\
		y_n \\
		\end{array}
    		\right],\quad
	\bX = \left[
		\begin{array}{cccc}
		1 & x_{11} & \hdots & x_{1p} \\
		\vdots & \vdots & x_{ij} & \vdots \\
		1 & x_{n1} & \hdots & x_{np} \\

		\epsilon_1 \\
		\vdots \\
		\epsilon_n \\
		\end{array}
		\right]
	\end{displaymath}
	\bigskip
	\myitem Then we can write the model in a more compact form:
	$${\by}_{n \times 1} = {\bX}_{n \times (p+1)}{\bbeta}_{(p+1) \times 1} + {\bepsilon}_{n \times 1}$$
	\myitem $\bX$ is called the \emph{design matrix}
\ei

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Matrix notation}

$$\by = \bX\bbeta + \bepsilon$$

\bi
	\myitem $\epsilon$ is a random vector rather than a random variable
	\bigskip
	\myitem $E(\bepsilon) = 0$ and $Cov(\bepsilon) = \sigma^2I$
	\bigskip
	\myitem Note that $Cov$ means the ``variance-covariance matrix''
\ei

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Mean, variance and covariance of a random vector}

\bi
	\myitem Let $\by^{T} = [y_1,\ldots,y_n]$ be an $n$-component random vector. Then its mean and variance are defined as
	\beqa
		E(\by)^{T} &=& [E(y_1),\ldots,E(y_n)] \\
		Var(\by) &=& E\left[(\by - E\by)(\by - E\by)^T\right] = E(\by\by^T) - (E\by)(E\by)^T
    	\eeqa
	\bigskip
	\myitem Let $\by$ and $\bz$ be an $n$-component and an $m$-component random vector respectively. Then their covariance is an $n\times m$ matrix defined by
	\beqa
		Cov(\by,\bz) = E\big[(\by - E\by)(\bz - \bz)^T\big]
	\eeqa
